Digit Recognition using Neural Networks (Keras)
This repository contains a neural network model built with Keras for digit recognition. Each digit is represented as a 7x7 grid, where every pixel has an intensity value ranging from 1 to 255. The 7x7 matrix is flattened into a 1D vector (49 values per sample) before being processed by the neural network.

Features:
✅ Input: Flattened 1D vector (49 values per sample)
✅ Model: Fully Connected Neural Network (MLP) using Keras
✅ Activation Functions:

ReLU for hidden layers
Sigmoid for the output layer
✅ Loss Function: Binary Crossentropy (for binary classification) / Categorical Crossentropy (for multi-class)
✅ Optimizer: Adam
